# Sanitize

Powerful model extraction from JSON requests.

## Installation

Add this project to the `Package.swift` dependencies of your Vapor project:

```swift
  .package(url: "https://github.com/gperdomor/sanitize.git", .branch("beta"))
```

> Alert: Some changes to Vapor 3 could break this PR, so in that case, wait until a new update was made

## Usage

### Model

Before you're able to extract your model from a request it needs to conform to
the protocol `Sanitizable` adding a `[String]` named `allowedKeys` with a list
of keys you wish to allow:

```swift
import Sanitize

class User: Sanitizable { // or struct
    var id: Int?
    var name: String
    var email: String

    // Valid properties taken from the request json
    static var allowedKeys: [String] = ["name", "email"]

    //...
}
```

Now that you have a conforming model, you can safely extract it from a Request

### Request Body

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Appleseed",
  "email": "example@domain.com"
}
```

### Routes

```swift
router.post("sanitize-example") { req -> Response in
    // User without 'id' because in not an allowedKey
    let user: User = try req.extractModel()
    
    // User with 'id' equals to 123 because is injected
    let otherUser: User = try req.extractModel(injecting: ["id": 123])

    let res = Response(using: self.app)
    try res.content.encode(user, as: .json)

    return res
}
```

### Pre and Post validations

You can also configure some `preSanitize` and `postSanitize` validations,
this validations will be executed before and after model initialization.

```swift
extension User {
    static func preSanitize(data: JSON) throws {
        print(data)
        guard data["name"] as? String != nil else {
            throw Abort(
                .badRequest,
                reason: "No name provided."
            )
        }
        
        guard data["email"] as? String != nil else {
            throw Abort(
                .badRequest,
                reason: "No email provided."
            )
        }
    }
    
    func postSanitize() throws {
        guard email.count > 8 else {
            throw Abort(
                .badRequest,
                reason: "Email must be longer than 8 characters."
            )
        }
    }
}
```
